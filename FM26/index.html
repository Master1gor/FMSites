		<h1>Rule files for Football Manager 26</h1>

		<p>I have created rule files for Football Manager - this is work in progress<br/>
		Please see the individual readme files for details and license</p>
		
		<p>If you find an issue or mistake in the rule files, please contact me <a href="mailto:masterigor@online.de">by E-Mail</a>.<br/>
		When you report an issue:
		<ul>
			<li>Please provide as much information as possible. A simple "it does not work" is very hard for me to guess what is going wrong.</li>
			<li>If you use files by other editors, please tell me so that I know the game setup.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Do your files work with files from other editors ?</b><br/>
			This is in fact not easy to answer. My files typically create only rules for the nations or continents. Qualification to continental cups is very fragile, so using my files together with nation files from other editors can break things. I advise to test it before you play. Holiday a game for 10 years and look at what is happening.<br/>
			Occasionally, to get the best realism, I had to move teams from one division to another. My rule files expect a certain amount of teams in each division. If files by other editors also move teams around, it can break things.<br/>
			Player database changes etc. should not be a problem, since there is no conflict for that.<br/>
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li><b>Can you create league rules for me, I will pay you ?</b><br/>
			I am sorry, but no. All my free time goes into creating the packs for all continents. I am doing this as a hobby for myself and sharing it with the community. If I would take money, it would feel like work and I will have all the stress of meeting up to expectations, making constant updates, and so on. By working for free, I take my own time and create the rules in a quality that I reckon is good to play with.<br/>
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li><b>I am creating my own rules, can you help me ?</b><br/>
			No, same reason as above.<br/>
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li><b>When is the next continent pack ready?</b><br/>
			Your guess is as good as mine. I try to average 3 nations per day, but sometimes with FM you run into unforeseen obstacles.
