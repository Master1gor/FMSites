		<h1>Football Manager rule files for OFC v24.4</h1>
		
		<p>In this package, you will find rule files for OFC Member Nations.</p>
		<p>I did my best to use realistic formats for all the leagues that are included. The rule files contain:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>real divisions and cups with real formats from 2023</li>
			<li>teams from the 2023 season</li>
			<li>all nations have transfer windows, registration periods, tv dates, match rules, prize money - when I was able to find this in my online research</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Compatibility</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>FM Database 24.3.0 (only)</li>
		</ul>

		</p>

		<p>The rule files are free, but every tip will greatly improve my motivation to provide updates and other federations, because I spent a great deal of free time researching and editing. So if you really enjoy the rule files, then every small contribution is greatly appreciated.

		</p>

		<h3>Installation Guide</h3>
		<p>Copy the .fmf files for the nations you want into the folder "&lt;My Documents&gt;\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2024\editor data\".
			The folder can be different if you have changed it in the FM24 preferences. The leagues should then appear the next time you start a new game in FM24 and chose advanced setup.
			Make sure you have the checkbox "add players to playable teams" checked. This is recommended, otherwise you may end up with a lot of greyed-out players.
		</p>

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>all rules files have been tested by me in the editor and the game as well.<br/>
		of course, it is always possible that there are issues and mistakes in the rule files. If you find an issue, you can contact me <a href="mailto:masterigor@online.de">by E-Mail</a>.</p>

						<li>I have removed the 3rd tier because I can not guarantee it will work. The reason is that theoretically, a league could get depleted if all teams promote to a higher division. There are not enough teams, B teams, etc. to fill up the gap. After thinking about this for a long time, I decided to cut off the 3rd tier and I refactored New Zealand into 1 reliable file.</li>

		<h3>Coefficients</h3>
		<p>
		I added coefficients for the OFC Champions League. Unfortunately, the coefficients cannot be viewed in the game. I was unable to activate that page, which is there for e.g. Europe.
		So, Because it is invisible it is totally intransparent what the rankings for the countries are.
		<br/>
		The coefficienta are averages based on the number of teams in continental competitions (e.g. if New Zealand has 2 teams in the competition then the points gained by those teams is divided by 2)
		Basically, nations get points for each team from that country:<br/>
		<ul>
		<li>2p for each match win</li>
		<li>1p for each match draw (a game that goes to penalties is concidered a draw)</li>
		</ul>
		Things I added:<br/>
		<ul>
		<li>3p for all teams that start in the Qualifying Round (5p if you use the file which also adds Tuvalu and Kiribati)</li>
		<li>4p for 1st place in Group Stage</li>
		<li>2p for 2nd place in Group Stage</li>
		<li>1p for reaching the Final</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

			<tr>
				<td>v24.4</td>
				<td>

						<li class="warning">Note, there is no update to New Zealand. In 2025 Auckland FC Reserves play in the Northern League. This team was added by me in the Australia file, so in order to get their reserve team into New Zealand, I would have to adjust also Australia. I felt unsure about this, and rather than breaking 2 nations I opted to leave New Zealand as is, and the team will probably be in FM26 by default and it can be added when that is available.</li>
